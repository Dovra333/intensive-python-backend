# Task 1
I hope that I got it correctly. If smth isn't correct, say me please.

# Task 2
Honestly I didn't understand very well. If I create function "give salary", how much money can I give?
You've written that employee wastes 100-540, so I can min give 540$ or more.
And calculate salary you mean check the balance?
